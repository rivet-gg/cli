## Only use classes for developer-facing APIs

We don't expect the user to use pure interfaces & functions; consuming well
designed OOP interfaces can be cleaner.

Examples of using classes: `Context` and `Runtime` are classes designed to have
a clean interface for the user.

Examples of using interfaces: `Trace` is a simple data container that can be
easily serialized & deserialized. There are standalone functions that can
operate on a trace.
